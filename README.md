Race tracker app
=================================

The Race tracker app simulates the progress of two players in a race. The idea is to demonstrate 
basic concepts of Kotlin coroutines. A user can start, pause, or reset the race with buttons in the 
UI. I learned how to use coroutines to handle concurrency and manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause an app to become unresponsive.
